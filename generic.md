For this assignment we had to create a web page using Jekyll and put on it three projects that we were proud of. The web page was originally part of a static site but after I added on to the project by doing some modification to the HTML and CSS Files I decided to make it a real website by connecting it  to a GitHub account. I'm planning to use this website on my resume as a link to not only show my skills in user interface design but also to give any possible employers a more in detail look at my abilities.
