			<h2>My specfic steps</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I was assigned to the Process planning sheet and section and also helped with finding the total costing. Process planning is the process of Identifying the methods used to produce a given part. It is a plan of manufacturing the product with information taken directly from the product design. This would be a task normally done by the process engineers. The processes I had to do are listed below. 

	Determine the basic manufacturing process
	Determine the order or sequence of operations necessary to manufacture in terms of operation routing, process details and process pictures
	Specify production tolerances on blanks and on auxiliary surfaces
	Specify the methods and means of inspection depending upon the accuracy desired
	Specify the process parameters for the various manufacturing operations selected
	Determine and order tooling and inspection gauges required to manufacture the part
	Determine and select the equipment needed to manufacture the part.
	Providing the necessary documentation to be used by the shop people.
