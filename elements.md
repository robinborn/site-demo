Along with my group members we made the casting for the bells where we had to cast the mold and filled the casting with metal to actually make the bells. A different group first made the mold and what we did was cover the mold with a coding called zip slip. That basically made it easier to remove the mold from the casting pattern later. We cut the bells out of the frames and worked on individual bells. My part was to participate in each step described. I also took photos of each step to share with the group and did a write-up to explain the photos and steps taken. I spent every class period and an additional hour every second or third Thursday working on the project. I missed one class because of illness and another because of the weather. To make them up I showed up in the lab to work after class the same day of the bad weather. I also stayed longer the following Thursday after class to work on the bells. Out of 15 weeks of class, and 30 days of class time working on the bells, if I had to guess I would say I spent about 80 hours working on the project.

		<h3>Step 1:</h3>
		<p>The first thing we did was help create the mold for the bells so that we could cast them. This included covering the mold in a gray substance called zip slip which would make it easy to remove the mode from the pattern later. </p>

		<h3>Step 2:</h3>
		<p>After we used the mold to make the caste itself, we got to the next step which was casting the bells themselves. This was simply filling the cast with molten metal and letting it cool. Once the casting process was complete, we would cut the bells out of the frame, using a bandsaw.</p>

		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p> After the bells were cut out and could be handled singularly, we would begin to remove the compacted sand that would stick in the bells from the casting process, usually with a hammer or pick or something of that type. We would also sand off any pieces of metal that were on the bell that we didnâ€™t want. To do this we would usually use the belt sander. While belt sanding, we would also sand the bottom down to make it even.</p>

		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p> And finally, we would lathe the bell to give it that nice shiny finish. We would lathe it either manual or by CNC coding that the group worked on making the whole semester, but finished around April 19.
